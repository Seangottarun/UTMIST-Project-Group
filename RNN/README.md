# Recurrent Neural Network using TensorFlow 2.0

# To Do
1. Implement basic RNN following the [TensorFlow Documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn)
- Also check other tutorials:
  - [adventuresinmachinelearning](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/recurrent-neural-networks-lstm-tutorial-tensorflow/) is good for intuition for RNN's
  - [TensorFlow guide to custom layers and models](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models#building_models) is also helpful to figure out how to
  create your own class
2. Test with test tensors
- currently trying MNIST
3. Use TensorBoard to visualize
